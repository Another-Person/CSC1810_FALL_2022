## In Common

From here, with obvious differences in things like file selection,
the CLion interface is the same between Windows and Mac.

## Create a New Project

Click "New Project".

Enter a name and select C++ 11.

![search](./cl1.png)

Click "Create".

Windows will need some configuration... let this percolate.

Hit OK when it's done.

On the Mac there was a dialog that I clicked OK too quickly on.
Sorry.

## Use

WSL was a good idea. Visual Studio Code was a good idea.

CLion is now known to be a better idea.
