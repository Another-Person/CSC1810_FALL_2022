# CSC1810 FALL 2022 SECTIONS 1 and 2

This is the class web page for CSC1810 in Fall of 2022 at Carthage College

Most of you will not read this page. This is sad. See next.

## A Note for Incoming Freshpersons

This is not high school.

I am not a religious person. However, 1 Corinthians 13 has this to say:

*When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I
thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things.*

A corollary: I generally help those who help themselves. The preceding
once showed up in a teaching evaluation. 

As. If. This. Was. A. Bad. Thing.

## Syllabus

The syllabus is found [here](./syllabus/CSC%201810%20Fa22%20Kivolowitz.pdf).

Most of you will not read the syllabus. This is sad. See previous.

## Meeting Times / Place

Section 1 meets MWF 10:30 to 11:35 Clausen 114.

Section 2 meets MWF 13:35 to 14:40 Clausen 114.

## Attendance

From the [syllabus](./syllabus/CSC%201810%20Fa22%20Kivolowitz.pdf):

**For every five classes missed, your final grade will be reduced by a
full letter. Absences due to sports, music, or any other campus activity
count as an unexcused absence. To be clear: A full letter grade means
exactly that. For example, a B+ will be reduced to a C+.**

## Arriving Late / Leaving Early

From the [syllabus](./syllabus/CSC%201810%20Fa22%20Kivolowitz.pdf):

**We meet for 65 minutes. There is little room to “leave early.” 
Therefore, leaving a class early will be counted as a half class missed.**

**We meet for 65 minutes. There is little room to “arrive late.” 
Therefore, arriving late to a class will be counted as a half class missed.**

## Accessing the Class Text

The text is an online service hosted at zyBooks.com. Of note is that
being online, it offers live exercises within the “book” that give
immediate feedback. These exercises are graded. Not doing these is like
tossing your grade in the trash.

Readings are assigned via Schoology.

## Chapters / Subchapters to be Covered

You are encouraged to read ahead. Below are the chapters and
subchapters we will cover. **However, we will frequently cover these
out-of-order.**

I am **NOT** jumping around to make things more
confusing. Rather, the opposite is true.
My ordering makes sense for teach. Their ordering makes sense for
writing a book.

| Chapter | Subchapters |
| ------- | ----------- |
| 1 | All |
| 2 | Not: 12, 15 |
| 3 | Not: 14 |
| 4 | All |
| 5 | All |
| 6 | All |
| 9 | Not 9.9 |
| 15 | Only 1, 2, 3, 11 through 18 |

## Projects

Project specifications can be found [here](./projects).

Projects permit one grace day without penalty. After one day
of lateness, work will not be accepted without
prior authorization.

## Installing Your Environment

Note: There is no complete agreement among the CS Professors about
what constitutes the *right* environment. I use the most Linux-like
environment I can reasonably manager. This means:

* Visual Studio Code (so Mac, Windows and Linux are the same).

* The terminal on Mac (almost identical to a Linux terminal).

* WSL on Windows (a Linux terminal).

Follow the steps below carefully.

### Mac

If "Notes" contains a link you must read the information to which
it leads.

#### Installing VS Code on Mac

Since this video was recorded, more choiced for the Mac are 
presented. If you have an "Apple Silicon", choose that (these
are the newest Macs). If you have an Intel Mac, choose that
(these are the older Macs). If you are not sure, don't click
Universal - instead click the Apple menu then click 
"About This Mac" and read the overview.

#### Installing BREW on Mac

Since this video was recorded, installing BREW has changed.

Instead of triple clicking the text as instructed, there should
be a clipboard icon to the right of the text. You can click this
to copy the text to your clipboard for pasting into your terminal.

The install now asks for your password. This is fine.

The install now pauses to ask if you're sure. This is fine.

Like in the video, now you wait.

The install no longer puts BREW in the path of programs you can
easily execute. Instead, follow the first instruction in "Next
Steps", namely copy and pasting the two shell commands into your
terminal. Now, BREW should be installed.

Our very own Professor Mark Mahoney has created a tool called
StoryTeller to explain code. He has developed a course
specifically for this class.
