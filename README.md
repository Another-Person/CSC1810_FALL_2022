## Attendance

From the [syllabus](./syllabus/CSC%201810%20Fa22%20Kivolowitz.pdf):

**For every five classes missed, your final grade will be reduced by a full letter. Absences due to sports, music, or any other campus activity count as an unexcused absence. To be clear: A full letter grade means exactly that. For example, a B+ will be reduced to a C+.**

## Arriving Late / Leaving Early

From the [syllabus](./syllabus/CSC%201810%20Fa22%20Kivolowitz.pdf):

**We meet for 65 minutes. There is little room to “leave early.” Therefore, leaving a class early will be counted as a half class missed.**

**We meet for 65 minutes. There is little room to “arrive late.” Therefore, arriving late to a class will be counted as a half class missed.**
